[/Ok, sure/, `
${STATUS} Escalated
Hi Lydia, This is Maria. Sorry to hear you're having problems with the Clear Cache Button. I see you have a Samsung Galaxy phone. Can you confirm what version it is?
`],

[/It's a galaxy s5/, `
Ah, that might be the problem. Our app actually doesn't work on that model anymore. Perhaps I could interest you in a new phone and contract?
`],

[/I do need one. but not right now/, `
No problem. We can easily arrange for a new phone and tell you more about variety of options to choose from. Meanwhile, you may enjoy the remainder of minutes left on your Premium Free Bee app so long as you use a compatible device with it. Rest assured that your load stays on your registered number.
`],

[/OK, I will do that. Thanks for your help/, `
You're welcome, Lydia. Did you need help with anything else?
`],

[/no/, `
Thank's for contacting PLDT on Messenger. Have a great day!
